# Classifying individuals to different ethnic groups (AFR vs EAS) based on genetic information from the gene ASIP and OCA2 (Stats Project) 

## Background and Objective
The study of human genetic variation has been essential to comprehending the evolutionary history and migration patterns of the world's diverse populations. The genetic basis of skin pigmentation in different populations may provide insight into the evolution of human populations and their capacity for adaptability. Two genes, ASIP and OCA2, have been linked to human skin pigmentation. (Jablonski, 2021). ASIP encodes a protein that regulates melanin synthesis, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye colour, while OCA2 encodes a protein that regulates melanin transport into cells. (McKenna et al., 2010). Both genes indicate significant population-level variability, with particular polymorphisms associated with distinct skin pigmentation phenotypes. Recent research has shown that certain ASIP and OCA2 gene alleles have been associated with skin pigmentation variation in different groups, including African (AFR) and East Asian (EAS) populations. (Batai et al., 2021). This research has underlined the relevance of ASIP and OCA2 in understanding skin pigmentation in various groups. Based on genomic data from the ASIP and OCA2 genes, this study seeks to classify people into two ethnic groupings, AFR and EAS. The study will assist in determining an association between genetic variants and skin pigmentation in various populations, enhancing knowledge of these traits' genetic architecture.
## Details and Data Description
In the data section of the report, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used to identify the locations of two specific genes: ASIP and OCA2. ASIP was found to be located at the genomic coordinates 11:34186493-34269344, while OCA2 was located at 15.10:27719008-28099315.
Genotype data for the study was collected using the 1000 Genomes Project database. The Data Slicer tool available through the 1000 Genomes Project website was utilized to achieve this. The data slicer tool was used to filter and select specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with the ASIP and OCA2 genes in the study. The selected SNPs were based on the human genome assembly (GRCh37.p13) and were stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files. Specifically, Phase 3 VCF files were used in this study. To ensure the selection of high-quality and representative SNPs, the EAS (East Asian) data file was filtered by population, including CDX (Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna), CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing), CHS (Southern Han Chinese), JPT (Japanese in Tokyo), and KHV (Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City). Similarly, the AFR (African) data file was filtered by population, including ACB (African Caribbean), YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), GWD (Gambian in Western Divisions in The Gambia), MSL (Mende in Sierra Leone), ESN (Esan in Nigeria), ASW (African Ancestry in Southwest USA), and LWK (Luhya in Webuye, Kenya).
The frequency and distribution of the selected SNPs within the sample population were further analyzed. Finally, any potential associations between the selected SNPs and relevant phenotypic traits of interest were assessed using the resulting data.
## Methods
This study investigated the frequency distribution of genetic variants in two genes, ASIP and OCA2, in African and East Asian populations. Genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project was used for this analysis.
Data Processing
For both the ASIP and OCA2 genes, a set of data processing steps were applied to ensure the quality of the data. First, rows with an allele frequency (AF) value less than 0.001, and a quality (QUAL) value less than 20 were filtered out using the 'filter' function in dplyr. Next, rows with double values were removed using the 'grepl' function. To check the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the HWE value was calculated using the formula: HWE = (AF + 2AF(1-AF) + (1-AF)). Rows with any NA values were then removed using the 'is.na' function. Rows with an HWE value greater than 1.009 were also filtered out. Rows with the variant type (VT) not equal to 'SNP' were also filtered out. Required columns were selected from the resulting data frames. To create a new column called 'SUPERPOP_AF', the 'AFR_AF' and 'EAS_AF' values were combined. A new column called 'ETH' was created to indicate the ethnic group of the individual. Finally, columns were converted to appropriate data types, including 'SUPERPOP_AF' (numeric), 'POS' (numeric), 'ETH' (factor), 'REF' (factor), and 'ALT' (factor). These steps were necessary to ensure that the data was of high quality and suitable for further analysis.
## Statistical Analysis
The frequency distribution of genetic variants in ASIP and OCA2 genes was analyzed separately for African and East Asian populations. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between genetic variants and ethnicity. The logistic regression model included the following variables: 'SUPERPOP_AF', 'POS', 'ALT', and 'REF'. The 'glm' function in R was used to fit the model, with the family set to 'binomial'. The significance of the coefficients was determined using the 'summary' and 'coef' functions.
To validate the performance of the logistic regression model, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted using the 'roc' function in the 'pROC' package. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Cross-validation was performed using the 'caret' package to assess the stability and accuracy of the model. Finally, the 'rpart' and 'randomForest' packages were used to build decision trees and random forests to compare their performance with the logistic regression model.
